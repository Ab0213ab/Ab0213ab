<h2>Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer and I am pursuing a B.S. in Software Development at <a href="https://www.bellevue.edu/?ab=b" target="_blank">Bellevue University</a>.</h2>

<h3>I am using GitHub as a space to save a few simple programs of which I am proud and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques.

I have not collaberated on any projects with anyone outside my cohort college classes yet, however, if you happen to stumble upon my repositroy I
would welcome any advice. Perhaps we will work together in the future, thank you for stopping by.</h3>
