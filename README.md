<h3>My name is Andrew B. Schaefer and I'm a backend leaning, Full-Stack Software Engineer with a passion for growth.</h3> 

<h3>I'm using GitHub not just as a tool to collaborate or for version control, but also as a space to save projects/school assignments of which I am proud. This helps me to track and showcase my progression as I learn new development techniques.
