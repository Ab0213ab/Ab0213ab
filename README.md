<h2>Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer and I am a B.S. in Software Development student at Bellevue University.</h2>

<h3>I am using GitHub as a space to save a few simple programs of which I am proud and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques. 

I have not collaberated on any projects with anyone outside my cohort college classes yet. However, if you happen to stumble upon my repositroy I
would welcome any advice. Perhaps we will work together in the future, thank you for stopping by.</h3>
