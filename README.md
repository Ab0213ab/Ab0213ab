Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer (@Ab0213ab) and I'm a Software Development student at Bellevue University.
I'm a technology late-bloomer, but I'm having a blast learning about the incredible world of programming.
Currently I'm learning Python and Java.

I'm using GitHub as a space to save a few simple programs I'm proud of and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques. 

I don't know enough to collaberate on any projects yet, but if you happen to stumble upon my repositroy,
feel free to give me some pointers if you see anything that could be better!
