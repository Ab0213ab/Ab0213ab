<h2>Hi friends.</h2> 


<h3>My name is Andrew B. Schaefer and I am a Back-End leaning, Full-Stack Software Engineer with a passion for progression.</h3> 

<h3>I'm using GitHub not just as a tool to collaberate or for version control, but also as a space to save projects/school assignments of which I am proud. This helps me to track and showcase my progression as I learn new development techniques.

<h3>If you happen to stumble upon my repositories, I would welcome any advice or enhancements for any of the code you see. Perhaps we will work together in the future, thanks for stopping by.</h3>
