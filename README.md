Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer (@Ab0213ab) and I'm a Software Development student at Bellevue University.

I'm using GitHub as a space to save a few simple programs I'm proud of and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques. 

I do not know enough to collaberate on any projects yet, but if you happen to stumble upon my repositroy,
feel free to give me some pointers!
