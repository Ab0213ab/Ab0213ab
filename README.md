<h2>Hi there. My name is Andrew B. Schaefer and I am a B.S. in Software Development graduate from <a href="https://www.bellevue.edu/?ab=b" target="_blank">Bellevue University</a>.</h2>

<h3>I am using GitHub as not just a tool to collaberate, but also as a space to save programming projects and school assignments of which I am proud in order to track/showcase my progression as I learn new development techniques.

If you happen to stumble upon my repositories, I would welcome any advice or enhancements for any of the code you see. Perhaps we will work together in the future, thanks for stopping by.</h3>
