<h2>Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer and I am a B.S. in Software Development student at Bellevue University.

I am using GitHub as a space to save a few simple programs of which I am proud and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques. 

I do not know enough to collaberate on any projects yet, but if you happen to stumble upon my repositroy,
feel free to give me some pointers!</h2>
