<h2>Hi there. My name is Andrew Schaefer and I am pursuing a B.S. in Software Development at <a href="https://www.bellevue.edu/?ab=b" target="_blank">Bellevue University</a>.</h2>

<h3>I am using GitHub as a space to save assignments and other programs of which I am proud, and to track my progression as I learn 
new development techniques.

I have not collaborated on any projects with anyone outside my cohort college classes yet, however, if you happen to stumble upon my repository I
would welcome any advice. Perhaps we will work together in the future, thanks for stopping by.</h3>
